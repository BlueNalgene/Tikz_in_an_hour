# Tikz_in_an_hour

This is an introduction to the basics of TikZ developed for the OU Math department in coordination with the Bizzell Library's STEM librarians.

## Speaker-Audience Expectations

- This is a beginner TikZ talk, but an intermediate LaTeX talk.
- This is intended to be a ~1 hour talk.
- The content is catered towards OU students, but this mostly applies to the final slides of contact info.

## What is Covered:

### Intro/Sources/Background

- What is TikZ?
- What can I use TikZ with?

### Environment - or the LaTeX portion of the talk

- Call the library
- Invoke the environment
- Scaling and Sizing

### Basic Tools
All of this section uses a single example which builds from a rudimentary triangle to a depiction of cos and sin.

- The core concepts
- Semicolon line termination
- Arbitrary points and sizes with examples
- Modifying connections and nodes with examples
- Grids/arrows
- Colors
- Arcs
- Fills
- Loops/text labels

### TikZ Libraries

This section lists all of the TikZ libraries in the PGF manual, and gives a single sentence description.

### Advanced Examples

- A scientific figure of a MOSFET
  - defining in the preamble
  - nodes and interacting with them
  - anchor points
  - shapes
- A demo plot of amplitude and frequency in a sin function
  - Data visualization
  - Programmatic color and dash changes
  - Plotting functions
  - Substituting normal connections with braces
  - Rotating nodes
- Where to find more examples (NOTE: class will click the link and find a fun example and observe what the artist did)

### How to learn more

- RTFM
- Asking questions on the internet
- Your local librarians
- And me!
